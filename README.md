- Cosmetics maintain higher stock levels
- Skincare shows demand exceeding stock levels
- Potential stockout risk in skincare category

---

### 3️⃣ Lead Time Analysis

![Lead Time](images/lead_time_by_product_type.png)

- Skincare has the highest average lead time (~16.7 days)
- Lead time consistency required to reduce delays

---

### 4️⃣ Manufacturing Cost by Supplier
